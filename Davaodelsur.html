Davao City as a rich and buzzling city, those who are fond of strolling with tall buildings around and a beautiful landscape in the background, will surely enjoy this place. One of the cleanest city in the Philippines, this city will offer a nice surrounding view as you cannot see a single trash and food wrappers in its busy thoroughfares. C.M. Recto and San Pedro Street let you experience a place without the irritating and eye sore spaghetti lines as these streets were the initial phases where the Davao City’s underground cabling was implemented. You may visit the city in August of every year and experience the colorful and enjoyable Kadayawan Festival. Fruits like pomelo, rambutan, Lansones, Marang, Mangosteen and the King of Fruit Durian were abundant in the city.
